## Iris Dataset Visualization and Analysis

This project offers an in-depth exploration and visualization of the widely recognized Iris dataset by leveraging the power of Python's prominent data processing and visualization libraries such as Plotly, Matplotlib, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.

## Project Description

The Iris dataset, often considered the "Hello, World!" of data science, encapsulates measurements of 150 iris flowers from three distinct species. The dataset features four attributes - sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

This project is designed to guide you through the process of data loading, processing, analysis, and visualization using Python. It loads the Iris dataset from the Scikit-learn package and transforms the data into a structured and workable format using Pandas. Further, it generates intricate and interactive visualizations to discern patterns and relationships within the data.

The project primarily includes the generation of two types of scatter plots. The first plot, constructed using Plotly Express, represents the correlation between the sepal length and width. This correlation aids in understanding how these two parameters interact with each other across different iris species. 


## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- [Plotly Express](https://pypi.org/project/plotly/) for creating interactive plots.
- [Matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/) for producing static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- [Pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/) for data manipulation and analysis.
- [Scikit-learn](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-learn/) for machine learning and data mining.

## Installation & Execution

**Step 1**: Clone the repository from GitHub to your local system.

**Step 2**: Install the necessary dependencies listed above. You can install these using pip:

```sh
